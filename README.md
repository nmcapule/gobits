# gobits

Some short programs in Go as part of my coding exercises in algorithms.

Most of it are straightforward. Just run with `go run <folderName>/main.go`.

## Sources

1.  [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) - Has the best list of coding
    exercises so far. Highly recommend. Note that **hard** problems here are
    ***hard***. I advice skipping on a few problems that you are stuck in. It's
    fine. No one's pointing a gun in your head.

2.  [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) - Sends you an email
    once a day. Pretty neat stuff. Hard problems here aren't really *hard* relative
    to the ones presented in LeetCode.

3.  [TechDev Guide from Google](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/?no-filter=true#!) -
    Neater stuff from Google. I advise completing the coding exercises from this
    site since they are very few but covers a lot of topics.

4.  foo.bar - Google secret challenges for coders. I got a link after searching the
    keyword `algorithm` in Google search. Difficulty escalates quickly! Good luck!
